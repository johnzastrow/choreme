### Testing the PWA

1. **Mobile Testing:**
   - Use Chrome DevTools device emulation
   - Test on actual mobile devices
   - Verify touch interactions and gestures

2. **Offline Testing:**
   - Disable network in DevTools
   - Verify offline functionality
   - Test sync when reconnected

3. **PWA Audit:**
   - Use Lighthouse PWA audit
   - Verify manifest and service worker
   - Check installability criteria

## Deployment

### Static Hosting (Recommended)
The built app is a static site that can be hosted on:
- Netlify (with redirect rules for SPA)
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Any static web server

### Environment Variables
Set these in your deployment environment:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` - Your production API URL
- `REACT_APP_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` - For push notifications (optional)
